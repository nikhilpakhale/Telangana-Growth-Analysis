This project was my submission for the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge #7 in collaboration with the Telangana Government and their Open Data Portal. 

**Objective:** Analyse Telangana’s growth among different sectors quantitatively and provide useful insights to the Telangana government that would help them to make data-informed decisions and further support the growth of the state.

**Data Source:** The dataset is taken from Open Data Telangana. Thanks to the Telangana Government for providing real-time datasets for public access which is a great learning asset - feel free to explore them here. (https://data.telangana.gov.in/).
